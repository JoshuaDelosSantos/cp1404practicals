## Main lessons about "clean code" in CP1404

- Consistent and meaningful names are not just for immediate understanding; they play a crucial role in long-term maintainability. Future developers (including oneself) will appreciate the clarity brought by well-chosen names.
- Building with an eye toward reusability pays off in versatility. The ability to plug and play modular components simplifies the development of new features and applications. It also encourages the creation of robust libraries that stand the test of time.
- Code should be self-explanatory to the extent possible. When comments are needed, they should provide valuable insights that go beyond what the code itself conveys. Striking the right balance between clarity in code and the occasional use of comments improves overall comprehension.
