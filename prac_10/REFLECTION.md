# Reflection

## Time estimates
Regarding the prac time estimates, my accuracy has improved.
As we move onto the later weeks, learning more efficient and correct ways to code has helped me with quality
and efficiency thus, leading to quicker times.

## Code reviews
Unfortunately, the majority of my code reviewers were not very helpful. Nevertheless, I was blessed with a quality
code review from Alex in prac_07 where we had to do project_management.py. For example, I learnt that instead of using
the datetime module in my console code to sort by the date, why not initialise the datetime in my class for efficiency.
That simple logic, had opened my mind into thinking 'outside' the box. Regarding doing a code review, unfortunately,
most of my code reviewees lacked quality in the code. For example, some of the reviewees codes used patterns we have
not done before, along with bad naming and poor function SRP. I did however learn a valuable lesson from a specific
review that I did. I thought that we were not able to call a function within a function, however, the lecturer stepped
in the conversation within the pull request and confirmed that we were allowed, as long as it is within the SRP.

## Practical tasks
In my opinion, it would be better if we had a massive program to do until week 10 constantly improving it since
from week 1. I think this would teach us a more hands on 'version control' and it would make us responsible for
good variable naming, function SRP and commit messages! Furthermore, this would teach us about code maintenance and
debugging large code. Moreover, I believe that this will distinguish students that are up to speed to those that are not.
